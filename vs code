Smart Contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. We are going to create our first smart contract.

Create a new folder and navigate to it.

mkdir hello-smart
cd hello-smart
Initialize Git to convert the folder to a git repository. Then initialize Yarn to convert the project to a node package. You can also use npm also, instead of yarn.

git init
yarn init -y
The skeleton is ready. Open the folder in a code editor. I am using Visual Studio Code. In the editor, create .gitignore file and add just one line to it.

node_modules
This will prevent Git from pushing node_modules folder to Git server.

Hardhat
Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment for us. It is a tool for building and deploying contracts to any Ethereum network. It facilitates frequent tasks like running tests, auto check code for any errors.

Add hardhat as a dev dependency to the project.

yarn add -D hardhat
Even though we installed hardhat in our project, we are going to run through hardhat steps using npx command.

npx hardhat
